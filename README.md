#  Angular To-Do List App

This is a simple Angular standalone component-based To-Do List application. It allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Delete tasks (with confirmation)
- Mark tasks as complete (with visual indication)

---

##  Project Structure

- `AppComponent`: Root component that initializes the app.
- `MainComponent`: Handles form input and passes data to the list.
- `TodoListComponent`: Displays the list of to-do items and listens for updates.
- `TodoItemComponent`: Renders each task, handles completion toggle and deletion.
- `TodoService`: Central service for task state management (add, delete, search, toggle).
- `models.ts`: Defines the `TodoItem` interface.

---

##  Features

- **Reactive Forms**: Used for input validation.
- **Standalone Components**: Clean and modular component setup.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Uses Angularâ€™s modern `@if` and `@for` syntax.
- **Conditional Styling**: Completed tasks appear differently (e.g., strikethrough).
- **Search Support**: Filter tasks by title.
- **Cookie Storage**: Tasks are stored in browser cookies for persistence between page reloads.
